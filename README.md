[![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/a98e3dca88b86d88fbcc/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/speshak/habitist-lambda/maintainability)

An AWS Lambda implementation of
[amitness/habitist](https://github.com/amitness/habitist).  Unlike the
original, this uses a schedule to fire and therefore doesn't need the webhook
or IFTTT trigger.
